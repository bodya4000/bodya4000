ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bohdan! I'm currently specializing in React and Java Spring web development.

ðŸ‘€ I enjoy teamwork and aspire to join a group of professionals to tackle challenging projects and bring innovative ideas to life.

ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm diving deep into React and Next.js to sharpen my skills further.

ðŸ’¡ I have experience developing a mobile fuel app using React Native. My favorite features from the project include push notifications and barcode/QR code scanning.

ðŸ’¼ I'm ready to work on exciting projects that align with my skills and interests. I'm also flexible and willing to adapt to new technologies.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me at shraierbohdan@gmail.com to discuss potential collaborations or anything related to Java, backend development, and more.
