ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bohdan, a Java Backend Developer. I love creating strong and scalable server-side solutions.

ðŸ‘€ I enjoy teamwork and want to join a group of professionals to tackle tough projects and come up with new ideas.

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm diving deep into Kafka to learn more about how it handles events and processes data in real-time.

ðŸ’¡ I'm particularly passionate about working in a team of seasoned professionals, where I can contribute my expertise and learn from others to drive impactful solutions.

ðŸ’¼ I'm ready to work on exciting projects that match my skills and interests, whether it's adding new features, improving what's already there, or trying out the latest technologies.

ðŸ“« Let's chat! You can reach me at shraierbohdan@gmail.com to talk about working together or anything related to Java, backend development, and more.
